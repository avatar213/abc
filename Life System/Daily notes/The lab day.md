Today is Sunday. I met the girls who I'll be working on the robot with. They was really chill and fun to talk. Finally, there is a person in this school who can relate to me. Especially Aiym maybe doesn't play chess well, not into CS as Bbut a more chill person and I don't think really same people work together well 
Writing it in the evening, with the "Stan" by Eminem and Dido in my head. Future myself this letter is for you. I know you're sitting somewhere in Cambridge or Boston, really busy, no time for shit but you must read this. I believe in you man, all of your ideas, projects. A school, a game engine and even a thing that beats GTA VI by amount of sales! I bet you'll use all the time and effort I sacrifised you for good only and you'll lots of money, that lot that I've couldn't even imagine. Money will be no obstacle, you'll be able to afford cool stuff like travelling, cars and food as it isn't. I didn't even jerk off today, just to not break your dopamine system so you won't be an addict. Cheers
